<!-- Supports the Google Cache in HTTPS. -->

<!-- However, there is an interesting question about whether we should
     append &strip=1 to all cache URLs.  This causes them to load without
     images and styles, which is more secure but can look worse.  Without
     &strip=1, the images and styles from the cached pages still load from
     the original, typically unencrypted, page.  With &strip=1, the
     cached page will be text-only and will come exclusively from Google's
     HTTPS server. -->
